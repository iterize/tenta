We love seeing people build cool things with Tenta! These are some of the projects we know about. If you know of a project that's missing from this list, don't hesitate to open a pull request ðŸš€

- [Ivy](https://github.com/tum-esm/ivy): A Python template for a data acquisition system automating the operation of a sensor node. This was created based on the experience gained from the development of the Hermes (see below) and other data acquisition systems.
- [Tenta Client](https://github.com/tum-esm/tenta-client): A Python client based on paho-mqtt implementing the full Tenta API.
- [Hermes](https://github.com/tum-esm/hermes): CO<sub>2</sub> sensor network developed within the [ICOS Cities PAUL project](https://www.icos-cp.eu/projects/icos-cities) at [Professorship of Environmental Sensing and Modeling at TUM](https://www.ee.cit.tum.de/en/esm/home/).
