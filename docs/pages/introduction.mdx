# Introduction

This documentation aims to cover everything you need to know to use Tenta in your projects.

If you get stuck somewhere or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to open a discussion on GitHub! If you find a bug, we're happy if you open a new issue. For more insight into MQTT than we can provide here, the [HiveMQ MQTT Essentials guide](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/) gives a great introduction.

When you're new to a project, you have a very valuable view of the documentation: You can spot ambiguities and unclear explanations much better than maintainers! If you find an error somewhere or if you feel there's anything that can improve these docs, please don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request on GitHub.

Alright, enough chit-chat, let's dive in! ðŸ¤¿
