Tenta allows you to manage sensors remotely and in real-time:

- Collect and store measurements and logs from sensors
- Configure sensors remotely
- Monitor sensors in real-time with an intuitive dashboard

Tenta is lightweight and composable. It is designed to be used as a building block in your IoT stack, together with other awesome tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), or [polars](https://www.pola.rs/). Sensors connect to Tenta over a language-independent MQTT interface.
