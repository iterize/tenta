# Data format

- 64bit floats
- EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) format and what to pay attention to
  - You can freely add or remove attributes from the measurements or send different measurements
  - However, everything tied to a specific attribute name stays with that name forever
  - Attributes with the same name in different measurements will be grouped together, there's no context except the name itself
- definition: message - measurement - data point
