# Data format

Measurements make up the overwhelming majority of the data in the system. They must be flexible enough to allow for different sensors and measurement formats and must be able to evolve over time without downtime. At the same time, they must be efficient to store and query and structured enough for easy export and analysis.

## Messages, measurements, and data points

Sensors send MQTT messages to the server. Each message contains one or more measurements. Measurements contain one or more data points, which consist of an attribute (e.g., `temperature`) and a value (e.g., `23.1`). Each data point is associated with the time Tenta received it, as well as the time it was measured and, optionally, the revision that was in use at the time.

Values are sent as JSON numbers and stored as 64-bit double-precision floating-points. You cannot send strings or binary objects. This is a compromise between flexibility and efficiency that we've rarely found to be limiting in practice. Note that you can represent integers and booleans as floats.

## Evolving measurement formats

You can freely evolve a sensor's measurement format by sending new or dropping old attributes. Changing a sensor's measurement format does not require changes to Tenta. Sensors can also use multiple different measurement formats at the same time. Similarly, sensors can send partial measurements, i.e., measurements that only contain a subset of attributes.

Note that although measurements are very flexible, once they are stored in the database, they are immutable. You cannot rename attributes, but you can always add new attributes. If you need to update values retroactively, your best option is to do this during processing.
