# Roadmap

1. Indicator if sensors are currently connected to the MQTT broker
1. Associate lon/lat/alt with each measurement and display this data in the dashboard
1. User management: add/remove users to/from a network, different roles
1. Demo instance to make Tenta easy to try out
1. Multi-tenancy: isolate data from different networks/sensors
1. Tagging system to record metadata (e.g. nearby construction work, changes to the hardware, ...)
1. Compress data in the database to use less storage
