# Roadmap

<br />

- [x] ~Live charts of measurements on the dashboard~
- [x] ~Optimize dashboard for mobile~
- [ ] Indicator if sensors are currently connected to the MQTT broker
- [ ] Associate lon/lat/alt with each measurement and display this data in the dashboard
- [ ] User management: add/remove users to/from a network, different roles
- [ ] Demo instance to make Tenta easy to try out
- [ ] Multi-tenancy: isolate data from different networks/sensors
- [ ] Tagging system to record metadata (e.g. nearby construction work, changes to the hardware, ...)
- [ ] Compress data in the database to use less storage
