# System overview

Tenta consists of a server and a dashboard. The server communicates with the sensors via an intermediate MQTT broker and exposes a REST API for the dashboard. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL+TimescaleDB database.

{/* TODO: Introduce demo instance here that can be used for all following examples */}
