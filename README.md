This project is developed for the ACROPOLIS sensor network under Patrick Aigner's supervision. We aim to support the ACROPOLIS project and further sensor networks with similar requirements.

The ACROPOLIS sensor network consists of 20 roof-level sensors and measures CO2 concentrations in the city of Munich. This project provides a platform to collect, store, and visualize the data from these sensors and manage and configure the sensors themselves remotely and in real-time.
